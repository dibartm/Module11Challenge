In Part 1, the project utilizes automated browsing with Splinter to visit the Mars news site. 
The HTML code is then extracted using Beautiful Soup. 
The objective is to scrape the titles and preview text from the news articles.
The scraped information is stored in a Python data structure, specifically a list of dictionaries.
In Part 2, the project involves scraping and analyzing Mars weather data. The HTML table containing the data is extracted either using Pandas or a combination of Splinter and Beautiful Soup. The extracted data is then transformed into a Pandas DataFrame with correct column headings and data types.

The data analysis focuses on answering specific questions. Firstly, the project determines the number of months that exist on Mars. Secondly, it calculates the number of Martian days' worth of data available.

Furthermore, the data is analyzed to find the average lowest and highest temperatures for each month. Similarly, the average lowest and highest atmospheric pressures for each month are calculated. To support these findings, data visualizations are created.

Lastly, the project estimates the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year, with a visual estimate allowed within a 25% margin. The resulting DataFrame is exported into a CSV file.

Note: The point allocations mentioned (e.g., 40 points, 15 points) are not explained in detail and may be specific to the project's grading or evaluation system.
